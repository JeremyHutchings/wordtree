### WordTree

 - Consume 1-n words
 - Create a tree structure
 - Indicate in the nodes of the tree, which nodes are full words, as it's not just leafs (i.e. ant and antelope)
 - Have a node be able to return it's word(s), be that the word to it's point and/or the words below it
 - Have each word node (word node being the node that is the end of a word) have a count for how many times it was passed in (commonality/frequency from the learning set)
